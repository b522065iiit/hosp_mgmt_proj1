This website is made of two components: 
Front-End(developed with ReactJS+Vite)(available in the folder hosp_mgmt)
Back-End(nodejs + expressjs)(available in the folder node-server)
So for viewing the website, after downloading the files, open the folders in VS Code separately:

hosp_mgmt:
in the terminal, write 'npm run dev' (without quote marks) and press enter
node-server:
in the terminal, write 'nodemon index.js' (without quote marks) and press enter

this note has been written with an assumption that the viewer has basic knowledge of javascript, website design and mongodb database.

A .env file has to be created by the viewer and necessary connection has to be established with the database, so as to enable the backend functionality of this website.
Also, some modules have to be installed manually, like:
flowbite
...
for more info, you can refer the project report pdf available in the folder.
