While the medical care itself is highly regarded, areas such as discharge instructions and appointment punctuality could benefit from improvement.</span>

          <p className="mt-5 line-clamp-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">"I recently had surgery at this hospital, and I cannot express how wonderful my experience was. From the moment I walked in, the staff was incredibly attentive and caring. The nurses in the pre-op area were kind and kept me calm with their reassuring words. My surgeon took the time to explain the procedure thoroughly and answered all my questions, which made me feel at ease. Post-surgery care was excellent, with regular check-ins and a genuine concern for my recovery. The hospital was clean, well-organized, and the facilities were top-notch. I highly recommend this hospital for anyone in need of medical care!"</p>

          <p className="mt-5 line-clamp-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">"I visited the hospital for an outpatient procedure and was quite pleased with the overall service. The front desk staff were efficient and got me checked in quickly. I didn't have to wait long before being taken to the treatment area. The medical team was professional and ensured I understood every step of the process. Although the procedure went smoothly, I felt the discharge instructions could have been more detailed. I had a few questions once I got home, but thankfully, the follow-up call the next day cleared things up. Overall, a very good experience, and I would return if needed."</p>

While the doctors and nurses were knowledgeable and kind, I felt that the wait times were excessively long. I arrived for a scheduled appointment, yet I ended up waiting nearly two hours before being seen. Once I was with the medical team, the care was excellent, and they addressed all my health concerns thoroughly. The hospital facilities were clean, and the medical equipment seemed up-to-date. However, the long wait significantly detracted from my overall experience. I hope the hospital can improve on this aspect, as the quality of care was otherwise commendable."</p>
